	<h2>Course info and Important Updates: </h2>
	<p>Oscillations and AC circuits using complex variables, Fourier series and integrals, waves on a string, sound;
	electromagnetic waves from Maxwell's equations<br>in differential form; physical optics</br>
	</p>

	<p>The official title for this course is introductory physics: waves. In fact, this course is somewhat broader than this. Apart from dealing with the physics of waves and 
	<br>osciallations, it will introduce a lot of mathematical techniques that will prepare you for higher level courses and real life research.</br>

  <h2>Advice: </h2>
	<p>PHYS273 is a course in which students first see the connection between applied mathematics and physics, at first it can be intimidating to understand the material 
	<br>but by doing the derivations yourself and reviewing the material often enough, it starts to become very interesting. Try to avoid using online resources (I know it's tempting)
	<br>instead, attend office hours or seek help from peers. By using online resources, you will put yourself at risk by doing poorly on the exams.
